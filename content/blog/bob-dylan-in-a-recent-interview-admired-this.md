Bob Dylan in [a recent interview](https://www.bobdylan.com/news/bob-dylan-interviewed-by-wall-street-journals-jeff-slate/), admired this song. He noted that it reminded him of his songwriting process:

“There’s a Duff McKagan song called “Chip Away,” that has profound meaning for me. It’s a graphic song. Chip away, chip away, like Michelangelo, breaking up solid marble stone to discover the form of King David inside. He didn’t build him from the ground up, he chipped away the stone until he discovered the king. **It’s like my own songwriting, I overwrite something, then I chip away lines and phrases until I get to the real thing.** Shooter Jennings produced that record. It’s a great song.”

So to write like Bob, go ahead and do a FLOW session (that is, write as many words, stream of consciousness lines as you can for awhile), and then only later EDIT (pick the parts you like best).
