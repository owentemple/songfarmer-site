## **Conclusion**

In summary, we believe that cultivating songwriting habits, collecting seeds, and moving back and forth from a FLOW mode to an EDIT mode while composing is how songs are written.

We believe that you will write **more songs** as you:

- Strengthen songwriting habits and increase the number of song ideas you get from songwriting routines
- Separate FLOW mode composing from EDIT mode composing to prevent writer’s block and getting stuck
- Gain skill to FLOW more freely

We believe that you will write **better songs** as you:

- Design songs to meet your goals
- Study what makes for “sticky” or memorable songs
- Gain skill to EDIT and improve early drafts of lyrics
- Gain musical skill with your instrument
- Learn from listening and performing how to use melodies and grooves effectively

We believe we can make something with our days. So go ahead and make something.
