[Jeff Tweedy's Subconscious Songwriting](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/jeff-tweedys-subconscious-songwriting/380290/)

From the article “Lyrics are a very tricky thing to write, because songs, in my mind, are ruled by melody. I really believe that melody does all the heavy lifting emotionally. When I write lyrics, or when I adapt a poem to a song, what I really want to do is not interfere with the spell that’s being cast by the melody”
