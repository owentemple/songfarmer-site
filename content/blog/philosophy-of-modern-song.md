The new book by Bob Dylan is [The Philosophy of Modern Song](https://www.bobdylan.com/books/the-philosophy-of-modern-song/) – essays on 65 songs he admires.

We’re gonna listen/revisit one a day, and today we’re listening to Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up”.

Here’s the list from the Table of Contents and a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7oK3UXsHYmC3PYGQFY5IOb?si=64d1e2e0020c4772) on Spotify if you’d like to play along- we’d love to hear your thoughts on these songs as we listen.

We’re considering this list to be the syllabus on a course Mr. Dylan is offering us with the book.
