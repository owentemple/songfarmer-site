The [Songfarmer App](https://app.songfarmer.com) got a major update today. If you haven't tried it in a while — or ever — now is a great time to check it out.

## What's New

**Redesigned from the ground up.** The app has a clean, card-based layout that works well on your phone or your computer.

**Song Seed Generators.** The app now generates songwriting prompts across three dimensions:

- **Setting** — a randomized location, time of day, and direction to place your song's action
- **Song Type** — a category of song drawn from a Dylan-inspired taxonomy of song forms
- **Theme** — a character strength or human virtue (based on the research of Seligman and Peterson) to give your song emotional and thematic focus

You can roll each dimension individually or hit **Generate Song Seed** to combine all three into one prompt. It's a quick way to get a seed when you're sitting down to compose and want a starting point.

**Habit Tracker.** The app now includes a pomodoro-style timer for the four songwriting habits from the book — Writing, Performing, Listening, and Reading. Pick a habit, set a timer (Normal mode for longer sessions, Mini mode for your daily mini habits), and focus. The app tracks your daily score and your streak, so you can see the evidence of your daily work adding up over time.

## Try It

Head over to [app.songfarmer.com](https://app.songfarmer.com) and generate a seed. Then set a timer and write something. That's the whole idea — seeds, habits, FLOW, EDIT, songs.
