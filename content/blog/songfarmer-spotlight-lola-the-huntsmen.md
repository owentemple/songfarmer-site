Recorded in Austin, the album features Lauren Hunt’s soulful singing backed by grooving, sturdy, and comfortable musicianship.

One song on the album "Reno" was composed with a song seed (writing prompt) generated using the [Songfarmer App](http://app.songfarmer.com/).

What song can you get growing from the seed posted below? What would a character or characters in this place and time be doing/thinking/saying?
