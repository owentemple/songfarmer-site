On the weekend of May 30-June 1, Gordy Quist and Owen Temple will launch Songfarmer™, with a songwriting retreat on Lake Travis in the beautiful hill country around Austin, Texas.

The creative retreat will be limited to 10-12 folks who are interested in exploring the craft/process/art of songwriting in a collaborative group setting. Through small group discussion, some one-on-one mentorship, and some co-writing sessions, Gordy and Owen will focus on training the mind to always be songfarming/treasure hunting, and hope to build a community of new friends that will stay in touch and continue collaborating.

The hope is that this relaxing, yet intensive weekend at a beautiful lakeside, hill country getaway, will renew your inspiration and commitment to the cultivation of better songs.
