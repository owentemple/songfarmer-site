On the weekend of November 20-22, Gordy Quist and Owen Temple will again host Songfarmer™, a weekend-long songwriting workshop. First launched in spring of 2014, now our fifth edition of the workshop will be held on Lake Travis in the beautiful hill country around Austin, Texas.

The creative retreat will be limited to 12-14 folks who are interested in exploring the craft/process/art of songwriting in a collaborative group setting. Through small group discussion, some one-on-one mentorship, and some co-writing sessions, Gordy and Owen will focus on exercises, techniques, and habits for training the mind to always be songfarming/treasure hunting.

The hope is that this relaxing, yet intensive weekend at a beautiful lakeside, hill country getaway, will renew your inspiration and commitment to the cultivation of better songs and we can build a community of new friends that will stay in touch and continue collaborating.
