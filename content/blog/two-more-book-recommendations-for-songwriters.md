We want to mention two more books that are super helpful for developing songwriters.

We have to extend much gratitude to Paul Zollo for his book [Songwriters on Songwriting](https://a.co/d/2CNF8IO). A few of the quotes that precede chapters in our [Songfarmer book](https://a.co/d/75IJJwg) are from the transcripts of Zollo’s interviews with the world’s best songwriters.

Thanks also to Tom Russell and Sylvia Tyson for editing a fascinating collection of observations by songwriters in their book [And Then I Wrote: The Songwriter Speaks](https://a.co/d/6T1wjZk).

These books unlocked a door for us, and we hope they do for many others.
