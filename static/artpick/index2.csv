"Anna Kareninaby Leo Tolstoy (1877). Annas adulterous love affair with Count Vronskywhich follows an inevitable, devastating road from their dizzyingly erotic first encounter at a ball to Annas exile from society and her famous, fearful endis a masterwork of tragic love. What makes the novel so deeply satisfying, though, is how Tolstoy balances the story of Annas passion with a second semiautobiographical story of Levins spirituality and domesticity. Levin commits his life to simple human values: his marriage to Kitty, his faith in God, and his farming. Tolstoy enchants us with Annas sin, then proceeds to educate us with Levins virtue.Total Points: 221 (MB10) (JBarn7) (CB7) (JBud6) (BMC1) (PCap4) (PC5) (CD7) (BEE9) (GG7) (RG9) (HaJ10) (DLod4) (MMCPH4) (MM10) (NM10) (PM2) (CM6) (SM10) (SON7) (TP9) (RPri8) (FP10) (APat10) (JSalt3) (LShriv8) (AMS10) (SS2) (ST9) (TW7) (SY10)""Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert (1857). Of the many nineteenth-century novels about adulteresses, only Madame Bovary features a heroine frankly detested by her author. Flaubert battled for five years to complete his meticulous portrait of extramarital romance in the French provinces, and he complained endlessly in letters about his love-starved main character so inferior, he felt, to himself. In the end, however, he came to peace with her, famously saying, Madame Bovary: cest moi. A model of gorgeous style and perfect characterization, the novel is a testament to how yearning for a higher life both elevates and destroys us.Total Points: 214(RB3) (JBarn10) (BMC5) (PCap6) (PC10) (MCunn9) (MD8) (BEE5) (EF10) (MGait6) (DG2) (MGri6) (JGil9) (RG6) (LG10) (KHarr3) (JI1) (DLod2) (TM8) (VM9) (EM6) (JMEND6) (CM7) (LM10) (RM 4) (RPri10) (AMS4) (LS1) (JSalt5) (SS9) (BU7) (AW8) (MW5) (SY4)""War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy (1869). Mark Twain supposedly said of this masterpiece, Tolstoy carelessly neglects to include a boat race. Everything else is included in this epic novel that revolves around Napoleons invasion of Russia in 1812. Tolstoy is as adept at drawing panoramic battle scenes as he is at describing individual feeling in hundreds of characters from all strata of society, but it is his depiction of Prince Andrey, Natasha, and Pierrewho struggle with love and with finding the right way to livethat makes this book beloved.Total Points: 167(PA 9) (RB 4) (AB 9) (SCraw 4) (RFD 9) (JF 9) (PF 10) (BH 1) (AHas 8) (HaJ 8) (KK 8) (TK 6) (NM 9) (PM1) (JMEND6) (CN 5) (APhil 4) (IR 8) (RR 10) (LDR 4) (GS 8) (CS 8) (MSimp 6) (AMS 9) (MW 4)""Middlemarch by George Eliot (187172). Dorothea Brooke is a pretty young idealist whose desire to improve the world leads her to marry the crusty pedant Casaubon. This mistake takes her down a circuitous and painful path in search of happiness. The novel, which explores societys brakes on women and deteriorating rural life, is as much a chronicle of the English town of Middlemarch as it is the portrait of a lady. Eliot excels at parsing moments of moral crisis so that we feel a characters anguish and resolve. Her intelligent sympathy for even the most unlikable people redirects our own moral compass toward charity rather than enmity.Total Points: 157(JE 6) (DAJ 8) (KA 7) (MB 4) (AB 8) (TBiss 10) (PC 6) (JC 6) (SCraw 6) (BEE 8) (KJF 10) (GG 6) (MG 1) (MGri 2) (AG 8) (KHarr 4) (AHas 5) (AHud 3)(SHust8)(DL 9) (DLod 5) (MMCPH 9) (JMEND 4) (LM 2) (FP 3) (JR 5) (MSimp 4)""The Great Gatsby by F.

Hemingway proclaimed, All modern American literature comes from . . . Huckleberry Finn.  But one can read it simply as a straightforward adventure story in which two comrades of conve nience, the parentally abused rascal Huck and fugitive slave Jim, escape the laws and conventions of society on a raft trip down the Mississippi. Alternatively, its a subversive satire in which Twain uses the only superficially nave Huck to comment bitingly on the evils of racial bigotry, religious hypocrisy, and capitalist greed he observes in a host of other largely unsympathetic characters. Hucks climactic decision to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest rather than submit to the starched standards of civilization reflects a uniquely American strain of individualism and nonconformity stretching from Daniel Boone to Easy Rider.Total Points: 136(LKA 9) (KA 2) (RB 8) (MSB 2) (CB 3) (FC 3) (CE 7) (PE 8) (AGold 1) (BH 5) (KH 5) (CH 9) (JHUMP 9) (HK 4) (SK 9) (WK 2) (WL 6) (BAM 4) (JCO 1) (RBP 7) (JR 3) (LDR 1) (GS 9) (CS 4) (MSimp 1) (SS 7) (SV 7)""In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust (191327).

Told the circumstances of this murder and usurpation by his fathers ghost, Hamlet is plunged deep into brilliant and profound reflection on the problems of existence, which meditations delay his revenge at the cost of innocent lives.

Famed for its hilarious antics with windmills and nags, Don Quixote offers timeless meditations on heroism, imagination, and the art of writing itself. Still, the heart of the book is the relationship between the deluded knight and his proverb-spewing squire, Sancho Panza. If their misadventures illuminate human folly, it is a folly redeemed by simple love, which makes Sancho stick by his mad master no matter how many foolish things he does.Total Points: 109(SA 6) (PA 10) (RB 10) (PC 7) (FC 9) (CE 9) (KJF 8) (AGold 8) (WL 9) (RM 8) (TP 10) (LDR 5) (PShreve 10)""Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (186061).

One does not need to believe in God to hear the majesty of the story that begins, In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. A great story itself, the Bible is also the source of great stories, by geniuses from Dante to Dostoevsky, Faulkner to Thomas Mann, and the poetry of the Psalms echoes through great poetry from William Blake to Walt Whitman to T. S. Eliot.One does not have to believe Jesus is the Son of God to understand that his parables are penetrating works of fiction that embody complex truths about human nature. One need not believe Adam and Eve existed to see Genesis is, whatever else it is, a philosophically sophisticated and psychologically acute story about peoples innate response to authority, even loving authority. And it is perfectly possible to believe Moses and King David are fictional, and yet find true to life the Bibles stories of these flawed men who succeed greatly, if only partially, while failing God time and again.And what of Jesusa god entering history as a man and living as a mortal?

Nabokov even provides an index to this playful, provocative story of poetry, interpretation, identity, and madness, which is full to bursting with allusions, tricks, and the authors inimitable wordplay.Total Points: 49(MC 9) (MGait 8) (MGri 10) (DL 7) (APhil 7) (VV 8)""Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West by Cormac McCarthy (1985). D. H. Lawrence famously remarked that the archetypal American hero was a stoic, a loner, and a killer. Cormac McCarthys tale of the formation and dissolution of a band of scalp hunters in northern Mexico in the late 1840s embodies that dire maxim. Led by a soldier named Glanton and a mysterious, hairless, moral monstrosity known as the Judge, these freebooters wipe out Indians, Mexicans, and each other amidst a landscape of such sublime desolation one feels it leaching into their very souls.Total Points: 48(MSB 8) (TBiss 7) (DAD 5) (BH 6) (SK 1) (MM 1) (GP 3) (BW 9)(IWelsh8)""To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (1960).

Dickens is best known for his immense plots that trace every corner of Victorian society, and Bleak House fulfills that expectation to perfection. The plot braids the sentimental tale of an orphan unaware of her scandalous parentage with an ironic and bitterly funny satire of a lawsuit that appears to entail all of London. In doing so, the novel encompasses more than any other Dickens novel, shows the authors mature skills, and is the only Victorian novel to include an incident of human spontaneous combustion.Total Points: 47(AB 6) (MGait 7) (MGri 9) (JHUMP 5) (SK 5) (IR 5) (BU 8) (AWald 2)""Persuasion by Jane Austen (1817).

Through them you enter the realm of the extraordinary, as revealed in the commonplace. Each of Weltys seemingly mundane people exhibits the depth, complexity, private surmise, and ultimate riddle of human identity. Every-body to their own visioning, as one of her characters remarks.There is plenty of high comedy. Few authors can match her eye for the incongruous, the hilarious response, the bemused quality of the way her people go about their lives. There is also pathos, veering sometimes into tragedy, and beyond that, awareness of what is unknowable and inscrutable.Her most stunning fiction is the group of interconnected stories published in 1949 as The Golden Apples. These center on the citizenry of Morgana, Mississippi, over the course of some four decades. In June Recital German-born Miss Lottie Elisabeth Eckhart teaches piano to the young. These include Cassie Morrison, who carries on her teachers mission, and Virgie Rainey, most talented of all, who in spite of herself absorbs the Beethoven, as with the dragons blood. In the closing story, The Wanderers, Virgie sits under a tree not far from Miss Eckharts grave and gazes into the falling rain, hearing the magical percussion drumming into her ears: That was the gift she had touched with her fingers that had drifted and left her.Weltys richly allusive style, alive to nuance, is not really like anyone elses. The dialogue (her characters talk at rather than to one another), the shading of Greek mythology and W. B. Yeatss poetry into the rhythms of everyday life in Morgana, the depth perception of a major literary artist, all make her stories superb.Total Points: 22(SMK 2) (LDR 7) (LS 5) (ES 6) (BU 2)""The Hamlet by William Faulkner (1940). The first novel in Faulkners Snopes trilogywhich was followed by The Town (1957) and The Mansion (1959)The Hamlet is a series of linked stories centering on the familys rise after the Civil War. Clever, ambitious, coarse, and unscrupulous, they embody Faulkners ambivalence for the New South, which he saw as a land of greater opportunity and diminished culture. Mixing humor, tragedy, violence, and pathos, The Hamlet is considered Faulkners last great novel.Total Points: 21(KH 7) (RP 5) (ES 9)""The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov (1966). Bulgakov reshaped his experience of Stalinist censorship into a surreal fable featuring three characters: an unnamed author (the Master) whose accusatory fiction is denied publication, his self-sacrificing married lover (Margarita), and the incarnation of Satan (Woland), who simultaneously orchestrates and interprets their destinies. The ambiguity of good and evil is hotly debated and amusingly dramatized in this complex satirical novel about the threats to art in an inimical material world and its paradoxical survival (symbolized by the climactic assertion that manuscripts dont burn).Total Points: 21(KHarr 9) (DM 6) (AP 6)""The Transit of Venus by Shirley Hazzard (1980).

A master of the small epiphany, the moment of clarity, Alice Munro writes of men and women who struggle to reconcile the lives they have made with their sometimes confused longings. Largely set in urban and rural Canada, Munros stories feature characters whose inner lives gradually peel away to reveal themselves in all their richness and complexity. Munros plots do not forge ahead in a linear fashion, but loop and meander and take their time getting where they need to go, slowly revealing their characters and revealing what lies behind the choices they have made.Total Points: 20(EC 7) (EH 4) (TJ 5) (LM 1) (CS 3)""The Charterhouse of Parma by Stendhal (1839).Appreciation of Stendhals The Charterhouse of Parma by Francine ProseOpening The Charterhouse of Parma is like stepping into the path of a benevolent cyclone that will pick you up and set you down, gently but firmly, somewhere else. You can still feel the tailwind of inspiration, the high speed at which Stendhal wrote it, and you cant help admiring its assurance and audacity.Stendhal marks the boundaries of the more traditional nineteenth-century novel, and then proceeds to explode them. Just as Fabrizio keeps discovering that his life is taking a different direction from what hed imagined, so the reader keeps thinking that Stendhal has written one kind of book, then finding that it is something else entirely. Stendhal writes as if he cant see why everythingpolitics, history, intrigue, the battle of Waterloo, a love story, several love storiescant be compressed into a single novel. The result is a huge canvas on which every detail is painted with astonishing realism and psychological verisimilitude.First you are totally swept up in Fabrizios peculiar experience of the Napoleonic wars, then moved by the Krazy Kat love triangle involving Fabrizio, Mosca, and Gina, and throughout, astonished by the accuracy of Stendhals observations on love, jealousy, ambition, and of how the perception of biological age influences our behavior.I love the way Stendhal uses Italian to mean passionate, and how he falls in love with his characters, for all the right reasons. One can only imagine how Tolstoy would have punished Gina, who is not only among the most memorable women in literature, but who is also scheming, casually adulterous, and madly in love with her own nephew. Each time I finish the book, I feel as if the world has been washed clean and polished while I was reading, and as if everything around me is shining a little more brightly.Total Points: 20(SCraw 7) (JF 4) (FP 9)""The Man Who Loved Children by Christina Stead (1940). Stead said that writing this novel was like escaping jail, and one feels that great cathartic sweep as the dark side of family life unreels through astonishing scenes pitting Sam Pollit, the egotistical father who loves children, against his wife Henny, a household hetaera subject to rages, or his fourteen-year-old daughter Louisa, a precocious, hulking girl whose break for freedom crowns the book.

Dostoevskys signature themethe future of morality and the human soul in a Godless worldtakes flight in this harrowing portrait of revolutionary terrorists who have surrendered their humanity to their ideals. The political satire throbs with urgency, but Dostoevsky raises this work to the level of art through rich characterizations of his combative principals: the well-meaning, ineffectual philosophical theorist Stepan Verkhovensky; his true-believing, monomaniacal son Peter; the conflicted,  serf Shatov; and two vivid embodiments of good and evilsaintly Bishop Tikhon and urbane, satanic Nicolas Stavrogin.Total Points: 20(PCap 5) (JH 10) (CM 5)""Waiting for the Barbarians by J.

Sexy, resourceful, and duplicitous, Becky schemes her way through society, always with an eye toward catching a richer man.

There was a copy in the library of my Scottish school; after all, the novel sold 40,000 copies in 1956, the year it was published. Perhaps it was even in my fathers library, squeezed between, say, Aldous Huxleys Chrome Yellow and Evelyn Waughs Decline and Fall, two novels I adored. The book was around but the truth is I didnt want to read it, in part because I associated it with Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, Wests massive tome about preWorld War II Yugo slavia, which I didnt want to read even more. I finally succumbed only a few years ago at the urging of a dear friend.Some books, much lauded on publication, rapidly gather dust, but luckily for me The Fountain Overflows remains as lustrous and passionate as when West penned the last page. The novel tells the story of the Aubrey family living in Edwardian London. Mr. Aubrey is a charismatic and unreliable journalist; Mrs. Aubrey, a former pianist, is an awkward woman of immense moral intelligence. Around these two orbit the Aubrey children: the musical Mary and Rose, the awful Cordelia who wants to be musical, and the beloved Richard Quinn. The story is told by Rose.One scene captures for me Wests genius. A man comes to complain to Mrs. Aubrey about her husband having an affair with his wife. After she has done her best to cheer him up, Mrs. Aubrey takes refuge in Madame Bovary and, by the time her husband arrives home, is absorbed in the novel. Together they praise and criticize Flaubert. Only then does she recall what brought herto pick up the novel in the first place. I am really very heartless, she cried, rising to her feet. But art is so much more real than life. Some art is much more real than some life, I mean.And this is exactly how I feel about The Fountain Overflows; it is more real, and more pleasurable, than most life.Total Points: 16(ML 7) (DMcF 9)""The Killer Inside Me by Jim Thompson (1952).

Chilling and absurd, teeming with black comedy and dark insights into the human soul, The Tin Drum is both an artistic triumph and an act of reclamation. As the Swedish Academy observed while presenting Grass with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999, the novel comes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: the victims, losers, and lies that people wanted to forget because they had once believed in them.Total Points: 14(JC 3) (MGri 5) (AG 1) (JI 4) (TK 1)""The Waves by Virgina Woolf (1931).

Dionysus seduces Pentheus into witnessing a Bacchanalian orgy, where he is torn to pieces by the revelers, including his own mother.Total Points: 10(CBollen2)(IP 8)""The Birthday Party (1958) and The Homecoming (1965) by Harold Pinter.The Nobel Prizewinning master of menacing understatement subtly links exfoliating, abstract power struggles with banal domestic situations in two of his finest plays.

In The Homecoming, a philosophy professors return to the domicile he and his wife share with his male relatives becomes a struggle for sexual dominance from which the lone woman emerges triumphant.

Cartmell and Charles Grayson (1947).Appreciation of The Golden Argosy by Stephen KingI first found The Golden Argosy in a Lisbon Falls (Maine) bargain barn called The Jolly White Elephant, where it was on offer for $2.25. At that time I only had four dollars, and spending over half of it on one book, even a hardcover, was a tough decision. Ive never regretted it.Originally published in 1947 and reissued in 1955but not updated or reprinted sinceThe Golden Argosy is an anthology of roughly fifty-five short stories. The editors made no pretensions to quality fiction, but simply tried to publish the best-loved stories published in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, up to the postWorld War II period.Though it is in terrible need of updating (there is no Raymond Carver, for instance, no Joyce Carol Oates, because such writers came along too late for inclusion), it remains an amazing resource for readers and writers, a treasury in the true sense of the word, covering everything from sentimental masterpieces such as Bret Hartes The Outcasts of Poker Flat to realistic character studies such as Pauls Case by Willa Cather.Every reader will find glaring omissions (Dorothy Parkers Big Blonde, for instance), but youve got your Faulkner classic (A Rose for Emily), your Hemingway (The Killers), and your Poe (The Gold-Bug). It includes The Rich Boy, in which F. Scott Fitzgerald famously observes the rich are different from you and me, and overlooked gems from writers such as Sherwood Anderson (Im a Fool) and John Collier (Back for Christmas).The Golden Argosy taught me more about good writing than all the classes Ive ever taken.

All the while the youngest sister, Taeko, aches for freedom from her sisters conservatism.

An amusing reversal of The Divine Comedy, this novel consists of letters from a senior devil (Screwtape) to his young nephew Wormword, teaching him how to tempt his first human patient to perdition. Lewis nicely balances theology and psychology, depicting hell as a bureaucracy with murderous office politics, and the loss of ones soul as an imperceptible poisoning through chains of seemingly inconsequential sins.Total Points: 10(DFW 10)""The Third Policeman by Flann OBrien (1967).Appreciation of Flann OBriens The Third Policeman by A. L. KennedyThe Third Policeman is that rare and lovely thinga truly hallucinatory novel, shot through with fierce logic and intellectual rigor. It is a lyrical, amoral, funny nightmare: the most disciplined and disturbing product of an always interesting writer. Our protagonist is the poor misfortunate bastarda drinker, philosopher, and obsessive bibliophile. His sins grow with him, making a logical progression from book theft to burglary and murderall this against a heightened version of poor, rural Ireland: a setting layered with absurd but weirdly recognizable detail. He then stumbles into a potentially fatal alternative reality: a haunting, teasing Irish countryside of parlors and winding roads from which it seems impossible to return.Beneath the music of OBriens prose there is always a savage understanding of our failings, the pressures of poverty, greed, and fear. And there is always the dark humor that both excuses and condemns us. Our hero (who develops an entirely separate soul, called Joe) drifts into a weird landscape of jovially menacing policemen (who may or not may not be bicycles) and of inexplicable objects and mechanisms that operate beneath natures skin. His imprisonment and threatened execution seem even more troubling because they are nonsensical, perhaps even kind. Slowly it becomes clear that, among other things, this novel is about hella much-deserved, amusing, irrational, and entirely inescapable hell. Because, for OBrien, hell is not only other peopleit is ourselves.Beyond this, The Third Policeman is genuinely indescribable: a book that holds you like a lovely and accusing dream. Read it and youll never forget it. Meet anyone else who has read it and youll find yourselves repeating sections of its melodious insanity within moments. Meet anyone who hasnt read it and youll tell them they must. Which will be the truth.Total Points: 10(ALK 8) (AO 2)""The Time of the Doves by Merc Rodoreda (1962).

The man was an entomologist and had set out into the desert with a canteen of water and a pack filled with the tools he used to collect specimens. It was his hope to discover an as yet unknown species of insect that lived in the sand dunes. Were he to find one, then he would be promised a kind of immortality: his name would be recorded and forever linked to the taxonomic identification of the bughis bug.Shifting sands, isolation, a quixotic attempt to defy mortal limits: even before the hero of Kobo Abes The Woman in the Dunes has missed the last bus out of the desert, the reader knows he is lost to an existential quest. Abe, trained as a medical doctor, writes as a clinician, dispassionately and with exactitude. In the dunes his hero, Niki Jumpei, falls captive to the enigmatic woman from whom he seeks shelter for a night. Having descended into the sand pit where the woman lives, Jumpei discovers that theres no way out; hes trapped in a sinister village where each citizen becomes Sisyphus. Every day Jumpei must join the inhabitants in their necessary work: shoveling away the sand that threatens to bury them and their homes.""The Woman in the Dunes"" transcends the form of allegoryoften lifeless and didacticto engage its readers to the point of discomfort. Its a claustrophobic novel, subjecting us to Jumpeis mounting panic as he begins to suspect that he will never leave the sand pit, that meaningless striving is his, and our, inescapable fate.Total Points: 10(KHarr10)""Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe (1958).

Subtitled The Decline of a Family, Manns first novel chronicles the shifting fortunes of four generations of German merchants. A brilliant literary colorist, adept with rich jewel tones, earthy pigments, and deep chiaroscuro alike, Mann recalls the Dutch Masters in his painterly command of bourgeois interiors and intimate domestic scenes.

Mann retells the Faust legend as the story of wunderkind composer Adrian Leverkhn, who trades his human feeling for a brilliant career and demonic inspiration.

Mann probes the complex tensions between aesthetics and morality, culture and politics, in his trademark dense, precise, endlessly qualified prose.

The final play in the Second Henriad (with Henry IV, Parts I and II), Henry V is, ostensibly, a celebration of Henrys victory over his archenemy, the French, at Agincourt in 1415. Henry thus construed is a great national hero. But the play actually subverts, or at least compromises, such a reading. We see Henry collude with the church to prosecute a vicious campaign for nationalistic, rather than necessary, reasons. The brave king broods on the burdens of kingship and the righteousness of his cause, but then casually orders the slaughter of French prisoners. The epilogue looks forward to the reign of Henry VI, who lost all that Henry V gained and more, as if to question the worth of all this killing.Total Points: 9(GDG 9)""Howl by Allen Ginsberg (1956).

The second miracle: A moving, humane novel composed of implausible, even impossible parts. Perecs brainy puzzle-book somehow produces the exhilarating, alternating certainties that life is beautiful, cruel, sweet, meaningful.Lifes hundred and some tales about the residents of 11 rue Simon-Crubellier sometimes slow to Proustian crawls, and a readers joy is in lounging, savoring every turn of phrase. A page later, though, Perec (almost audibly laughing) gallops us into insane plots of revenge, kleptomaniacal magistrates, intricate con games, a billionaires entire life spent on a single project, and the heiresss egg collection, the destruction of which prompted the inaccurate painting, which later hung in . . .Pictures within pictures, memories within memories, letters within letters, reflections of reflections, the novel represents the unachievable ambitions of the painter Valne, burning to accomplish on canvas what Perec actually did in text: a portrait of life in all its possibility, speed, variety, shimmer, impermanence, blindingly rich and achingly temporary.Published in 1978, Life is infinitely entertaining, but it also can change how you see your surroundings; the wall between novel and world leaks. If Perec can imagine four paintings (and their histories) reproduced inside yet another painting, and the wallpaper against which that work hangs, and the life of the man who selected the wallpaper, then suddenly the world outside the book more proudly displays its own wondrous plumage, imagined by some creator even more ingenious than Perec. That all of his work (or Valnes, or Perecs) is so painfully transient only adds to its splendor, just as the lives led in the apartments at 11 rue Simon-Crubellier are both madly full and too quickly finished, forgotten.Total Points: 9(APhil 9)""Mahabharata (fifth century b.c.e.).

Molires comedy ranges from slapstick (The Doctor in Spite of Himself is as silly, and funny, as a Punch and Judy show) to the social satire of his greatest play, The Misanthrope, in which a mans vow never to lie collides with societys need for white lies.

All the while, St. Aubyn examines the web of false promises that entangle this once illustrious familywhose last vestige of wealth, an old house in the south of Franceis about to be donated by Patricks mother to a New Age foundation.

In Either/Or, using the voices of two characters - the aesthetic young man of part one, called simply 'A', and the ethical Judge Vilhelm of the second section - Kierkegaard reflects upon the search for a meaningful existence, contemplating subjects as diverse as Mozart, drama, boredom, and, in the famous Seducer's Diary, the cynical seduction and ultimate rejection of a young, beautiful woman. A masterpiece of duality, Either/Or explores the conflict between the aesthetic and the ethical - both meditating ironically and seductively upon Epicurean pleasures, and eloquently expounding the noble virtues of a morally upstanding life.Siri Hustvedt observes: This is either the novel as philosophy or philosophy as the novel by the master of irony himself. It is, in all events, a long work of prose fiction, written under a pseudonym with a fictional editors introduction. Diabolical in its wit, passionate, and sly, it is a book at once immensely difficult and deeply pleasurable to read.Total Points: 7(SHust7)""Gargantua and Pantagruel by Franois Rabelais (four books published between 1532 and 1552).Appreciation of Franois Rabelais Gargantua and Pantagruel by Fred ChappellThe stories of the giant Gargantua and his giant son Pantagruel, of their birth, nurture, education, and heroic feats of arms; of Pantagruels voyages through strange lands and exotic cultures in search of ultimate wisdom; of their companions Rondibilis, Frre Jean, and the irrepressible, inexpressible Panurge; of their arriving at last in the abode of the Priestess Bacbuc whose oracular Bottle utters the final truth they have soughtthese stories are impossible to summarize and set in order.It would be presumptuous even to try to do so, since one of the great themes of Franois Rabelais (1494?1553) is glorious, raucous, exasperating, exhilarating, universal disorder. The author, a maverick cleric and observant physician, gave our modern world, at the moment of its birth in the Renaissance, its first comprehensive picture of what it was and what it could become. The world borrowed his name for its most treasured and common kind of humor: Rabelaisian, meaning rowdy, rude, satirical, unsparing, obscene, and sometimes cruel.As Rabelais invented a new literary form, the exorbitant picaresque satire, he invented a new language to express it. His pages are a Babel of polyglot puns, monkish obscurities, legalisms, overblown fustian, and street demotic. Lists abound: diseases and cures, body parts, herbs, geographical oddities, and cusswords in droves.Here is fantasy rooted in folktale, offering what only the great literary fantasiesThe Faerie Queene, The Tempest, Paradise Lost, Orlando Furioso, The Time Machine, and a few otherscan: a vision of humanity in its relationship with the cosmos and with eternity. At the same time, it presents an earthy panorama of daily concerns and relationships. Unique among the great visionary works, Gargantua and Pantagruel is the only slapstick comedy.

Shining through Ovids poetic encyclopedia of myths involving the transformations of gods and humans is this Heraclitean truth: existence is change. His versions of Orpheus, Narcissus, Pygmalion, and Hercules have been etched in our collective memory.

These grimly naturalistic novels, set in an inland world of house trailers and logging camps, depict the harsh lives and quiet dignity of the rural poor in Maine. The trilogy moves outward: The first novel creates a series of characters that are real grotesques, offering vignettes of adultery, drunkenness, and destroyed dreams. Life gets no easier in the second novel, but Big Lucien Letourneau, who runs an automobile junkyard, displays a rare and generous compassion. The third novel, which has the most political overtones, echoes the legend of Robin Hood to suggest how Egypt, Maine, and her people have been exploited.Total Points: 7(MSB 7)""The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler (1939).

After being tried and convicted, he immediately insisted on being executed for his crime. To do so, he fought a system that seemed intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death. And that fight for the right to die is what made him famous. Mailer tells not only Gilmore's story, but those of the men and women caught in the web of his life and drawn into his procession toward the firing squad. All with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscape and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah.Total Points: 6 (CBollen6)""The Green House by Mario Vargas Llosa (1965).Appreciation of Mario Vargas Llosas The Green House by David Anthony DurhamI remember wandering through the world literature section of my university library, feeling a bit lost, recognizing few names. On the recommendation of my writing instructor I was searching for a Peruvian novelist named Mario Vargas Llosa. I found a coverless edition of The Green House, one with no blurbs, no review quotes, no author photo or biography. The surprises found inside, then, were complete and unforgettable.With The Green House (1966), Vargas Llosa began to explore the ongoing battle that started the moment European culture collided with that of the Americas. The novel is populated by all segments of Peruvian society: indigenous Indians, people of Latin origins, immigrants cast ashore on Peru for myriad reasonsfrom nuns and Fathers to prostitutes and pimps. Theres even a Brazilian rubber baronwarlordleper of Japanese ancestry. It ranges from the depths of the rainforest to windblown desert outposts. Its a novel in which crimes are committed without remorse, conveyed with the brutal honesty of an author confronting the duplicitous exploitation tainting his nation.The story is rendered in prose as varied as its cast: inner monologue, assimilated dialogue, objective third person, or an omni scient point of view, with multiple timelines, concurrent plots, and scenes repeated in layering montage. Honestly, its rarely an easy read. One can see the influence of Faulkner, of Sartre and Flaubert, but the manner in which Vargas Llosa transmuted Western influences to enrich his tale remains remarkable. And, I wondered, if this Peruvian writer could do this, what else might be happening out there? By inspiring that question The Green House drew me into a much more complete world of literature. Ive been grateful to Vargas Llosa ever since.Total Points: 6(DAD 6)""The Horses Mouth by Joyce Cary (1944).

One was outrageously large and ugly, Bedford tells us in the opening paragraph; the other was beautiful. They were a huge Wilhelminian town house in the old West of Berlin, built and inhabited by the parents of my fathers first wife, and a small seventeenth-century chteau and park in the South, near the Vosges, bought for my father by my mother.So Bedford sets us down, with remarkable velocity and confidence, right in the middle of the world to which she is going to devote the next 360 pages. This is the world of Germany before the Second World War. The owners of the Wilhelminian townhouse are Jews; the heroines father is a Catholic aristocrat living in a sort of splendid rural poverty. As she is bundled to and fro between these two houses, our narratora version of Bedford herselfdescribes for us not just the struggle of her own growing up, but the complex intermingling of three very different families, as well as the rumblings of social and political change that underlie and ultimately disrupt the domestic and marital dramas in which she is enmeshed.Because Bedford published A Legacy in 1956, her knowledge of what was to come invests the novel with an air of fragility and foreboding. The prose is stunning; raised in a mire of European languages, Bedford clung to English as a life raft, and she shows her gratitude by employing her adopted language with a grace and agility to rival Henry Jamess. Yet what is perhaps most astonishing about this astonishingly rich novelmore memorable, for me, even than E. M. Forsters Howards End, the other great English novel about housesis the deftness with which its author reconciles two literary virtues that in other hands might seem irreconcilable: intimacy and grandeur.Total Points: 5(DL 5)""A Severed Head by Iris Murdoch (1961).

It seems absurd a writer of such worth should bother serving coffee to anyone, but its precisely this humility, this willingness to serve others, whether it be coffee, or novels, or testimonies, or tamales, that makes Elena Poniatowska a writer as well loved by cab drivers as by professors. The title alludes to France, but if youre hip to Mexico City, youll know La Flor de Lis is also the famous tamale restaurant in la colonia Condesa.""La Flor de Lis"" is a love story about mother and motherland, about love of Mxico lindo y querido (pretty and best), a culture where mothers are revered as goddesses, and a goddess, la Virgen de Guadalupe, is revered because she is the mother.Its a fairy tale told in reverse. Daughters of royalty flee France under siege from World War Il, and in the course of their childhood and adolescence in Mexico, we witness the discovery of what it means to belong to a culture, what it means to fall in love, and what, after all, it means to be a woman, because the story is steeped in the body of a woman, in the body of that country.Nowhere else have I read anyone describe the joy of scrubbing a courtyard with a bucket of suds and a broom. But its el zcalo, the central plaza of Mexico City that the narrator wants to scrub out of puro amor. And that ultimately sums up how a writer like Elenita became Elena Poniatowska. What we do for love, after all, is the greatest work we can do.Total Points: 5(SC 5)""Mildred Pierce by James M. Cain (1941).

He returned not only rejuvenated but transformed; in coming decades he would write, among other works, three classic novels: Posthumous Memoirs of Brs Cubas, Philosopher or Dog?, and Dom Casmurro.Dom Casmurro (Lord Taciturn) is Bento Santiago, an affluent old man undone by jealousy. He believes that his wife, Capitu, betrayed him; his friend Escobar must be the real sire of Bentos son. Yet whats most remarkable here is not the story but the storytelling. Theres its fragmented form (148 chapters in scarcely 250 pages); theres Machados mixture of scathing satire with empathy for his narrator, whose autobiography is part legal brief, part cri de coeur, part special pleading, even (covertly, poignantly) part mea culpa. But Machados signal feat is his pioneering handling of unreliable narration.Though Bento prosecutes his case zealously, his evidence boils down to the oft-repeated fact that Capitu has eyes like the tide. Bento may be deluded, even reprehensible, but we are not allowed to laugh at him, to think ourselves superior. Hes like us. And if every narrator is subject to similar blindness and self-pity, how to trust anyone? The question would loom large in twentieth-century literature.The reader, too, is implicated. Bento writes, [E]verything is to be found outside a book that has gaps, gentle reader. This is the way I fill in other mens lacunae; in the same way you may fill in mine. Reader, jury, do with me what you will. Machado admits into his text radical postmodern ambiguity, years before its heyday, for what book does not have gaps, is not made up of gaps?Allusive, psychologically penetrating, politically charged, darkly funny, Dom Casmurro links Sterne to Barthelme, Flaubert to Nabokov, and remains startlingly fresh.Total Points: 4(MGri 4)""Dont Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight by Alexandra Fuller (2001).

His protagonist, Ursula Brangwen, breaks from family tradition by going off to college and becoming a teacher. Free-spirited Ursula also experiments with her sexuality, having an affair with a Polish exile, Anton Skrebensky, and developing an intense attraction for an older woman. Her search for love is alternately disillusioning and liberating.Total Points: 4(JCO 4)""The Road to Wellville by T.C. Boyle (1993).

In this epic and often comic tale of retribution, greed, and ambition, sixty-nine-year-old spinster Mattie Ross recalls her youthful struggle to hunt down her fathers killer in the wild Indian territory of the 1870s. While Ross studies her scripture, she breaks bread with the foul-mouthed, seldom-sober Marshall who is helping her. Both a womans coming-of-age saga and an adventure riddled with biblical allegory, the novel reveals the depth of grit in characters plagued by contradictions.Total Points: 4(GP 4)""Vile Bodies by Evelyn Waugh (1930).

In a writing career of only two decades, from 1590 to 1610, Shakespeare produced the most influential canon of dramatic literature in history. His early romantic comedies (A Midsummer Nights Dream), his darker mature comedies (Measure for Measure), his history-shaping history plays (Henry IV, Parts I and II, and Henry V), the great core tragedies (Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, and King Lear), the late Roman plays (Antony and Cleopatra), and the final romances (The Tempest) are enduring monuments to an unparalleled genius. He was also a great poet. His 154 sonnets have shaped the efforts of every true poet thereafter. Indeed, Shakespeares two nondramatic poemsthe Ovidian erotic poem Venus and Adonis of 1593 and its darkly brilliant sequel The Rape of Lucrece of 1594were blockbusters that launched the young writers brilliant career.Total Points: 4(ST 4).""A Far Cry from Kensington by Muriel Spark (1988).

She spends her days and evenings giving advice to her eccentric rooming house mates and her coworkers in book publishing.

An experimental novel that plays with form and format  including colored words, vertical footnotes and appendices - House of Leaves novel focuses on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story -- of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.Total Points: 3(TLeClair 3)""Jacobs Room by Virginia Woolf (1922).

His vivid you-are-there prose transports readers to the untamed land filled with rough-hewn people. The books second section, a travelogue begun seven years later, in 1882, is memoiristic and meditative.

Through this portrait, Salter suggests that each persons life is mysterious, it is like a forest; from far off it . . . can be comprehended, described, but closer it begins to separate, to break into light and shadow, the density blinds one.Total Points: 3(PCam 3)""Maigret series of detective novels by Georges Simenon (190389).Appreciation of Georges Simenons Maigret Detective Novels by Iain PearsThe Maigret series of detective stories, written by the Belgian Georges Simenon, are part of that rare breed of booksthe mass-market entertainment that also works as great literature. Simenon is the master of atmosphere; with the lightest of touches he is able to conjure up Paris in the 1940s and 1950s, a seedy, largely poor city of shabby concierges and downtrodden traveling salesmen, of cheap hotels and squalid nightclubs, of hissing steam radiators and grubby shirt collars.Much of the narrative is liquor soakedMaigret begins drinking after breakfast, interviews witnesses over brandy, and suspects over beer. Only rarely is a case concluded by unraveling clues; these are not whodunits. Rather, they are studies in character, of place, and of people. Simenon would have been a brilliant analyst. As often as not, the books end when Maigret (and through him, the reader) so understands the criminal that the suspect confesses all. Indeed, the reader is usually left sympathizing with the criminal, whose crime is reacting to limited choices and desperate circumstances.The books are so compressed they could almost be short stories, but Simenon populates them with an extraordinary range of charactersthe overweight, perpetually sweating Maigret, his eternally patient wife (more acute, in many ways, than her husband), his juniors, and the gallery of pimps and prostitutes, petty criminals, shopkeepers, bartenders, small tradesmen, and canal barge pilots who make up his world. There is no reveling in the grime of the underworld; most of the characters dream of better things and live a life of disappointment. Out of their lives, Simenon created some of the most enduring and compelling works of the twentieth century.Total Points: 3(IP 3)""Mason & Dixon by Thomas Pynchon (1997).Charles Mason (1728-1786) and Jeremiah Dixon (1733-1779) were the British surveyors best remembered for running the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland that we know today as the Mason-Dixon Line.

Like the runners high or Zen meditation, Becketts opus yields the transcendence that succeeds tedium and pain. The trilogy chronicles a descent into living death by three narrators: vagabond, cripple, misfit. These characters are by degrees banished from the landscape, stripped of their paltry possessions, thrown back on the scatological world of the body, and ultimately confined to the madhouse of their heads, where language alone sustains and betrays them. Becketts trademark black humor and the stubborn, paradoxical endurance of these voices lighten a terminally bleak vision.Total Points: 3(PA 2) (LMill 1)""Montana 1948 by Larry Watson (1993).

One of the earliest examples of English naturalism, this grim chronicle of literary life in late-Victorian London bitterly portrays its authors own struggles to live from his writing. In contrasting dedicated artist Edwin Reardons commercial failure with superficial romancer Jasper Milvains popular success, Gissing pointedly skewers the distorted values of the marketplace, while tirelessly enumerating the many forces working against artistic purity and sincerity. The novel is a diatribe, yet lucid characterizations (particularly that of Reardons depressed, demanding wife) and raw accusatory intensity give it a claustrophobic, nagging power.Total Points: 3(JL 3)""Ninety-two in the Shade by Thomas McGuane (1973).

Hes a dirty urchin full of frustrated want and suppressed rage who lives in a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood (circa 1940) with his weak-willed mother and grandfather and, most important, his bitterly cruel, tyrannical grandmother. She makes his misery her first priority, calculating every move to maximize his exquisitely perfect emotional torment; for his part Red gradually learns to parry each of her sly thrusts with an equally sly one of his own. Eventually, he derives the lions share of his meager joy in life from the daily toil of returning her loathing and attempting to give as bad as he gets. In brutal simplicity, with recourse to uniquely effective listing devices, the precise and beautiful prose lays bare the excruciating particularities of Reds pain and shame and makes palpably real his journey from, if not innocence, at least relative neutrality toward craftiness and deft manipulation. With the grace and rigor of thought and language that earned Sorrentinos reputation as a master of stylistic play and cold humor, Red the Fiend describes in direct terms this increasingly dangerous battle of wills as it rises to its unbearable boiling point. No other novel in recent memory evokes the desolation of lovelessness with such blunt passion.Total Points: 3(LMill 3)""River of Earth by James Still (1940).

Farrell.Appreciation of James T. Farrells Studs Lonigan Trilogy by Tom WolfeTo writers born after 1950, James T. Farrell (190479) is known, if at all, as a plodding realist who wrote a lot of dull, factual novels now as dead and buried as he is. To writers born from, say, 1925 to 1935, however, the very name James T. Farrell strums the heartstrings of youth. To be young and to read Farrells first novel, Studs Lonigan! It made one tingle with exhiliration and wonder. How could anybody else understand your own inexpressible feelings so well?A trio of novels published between 1932 and 1935, the Studs Lonigan trilogy is an accountstory implies more plot than it actually hasof growing up in a lower-middle-class Irish-Catholic neighborhood in Chicago as Farrell did. He had the wit to make Studs a boy not like himself at all but like the sort of self-willed tough kid who probably made Farrells own school days miserable by calling him Goof and pulling the goofs cap down over his eyes, eyeglasses and all. The books opening lines stamp Studss studied pose indelibly:Studs Lonigan, on the verge of fifteen, and wearing his first suit of long trousers, stood in the bathroom with a Sweet Caporal pasted in his mug. His hands were jammed in his trouser pockets, and he sneered. He puffed, drew the fag out of his mouth, inhaled and said to himself:Well, Im kissing the old dump goodbye tonightthe old dump being a parochial junior high school.I am convinced Farrell wrote those lines as a low-rent reprise to the far more famous lines James Joyce had opened Ulysses with eighteen years earlier: Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:Introibo ad altare Dei.Introibo ad altare Dei. For that bit of showboating by an Irish-Catholic intellectual in Dublin, Farrell had a good low-rent American raspberry: Well, Im kissing the old dumpa Catholic schoolgoodbye tonight.Farrell, plodding realism and all, was quite conscious of Joyce and all other experimental writing of the early twentieth century. In Studs Lonigan he continually uses Joyces most famous device, stream of consciousness, and in a more sophisticated way than the maestro. He just doesnt feel the need to keep prodding the reader with his elbow as if to say, Be alert. This is experimental writing.It is precisely through Joycean stream of conciousness that Farrell brings us beneath Studss hide, which the fourteen-year-old boy keeps as thick as he can, and shows us the tenderness, the love, and the sense of beauty Studs will do anything to prevent the world, meaning the other boys his age on the block, from detecting.To me, section IV of Chapter Four of the first novel, Young Lonigan, is one of the few sublime reflections of the feeling of being in love in all of literature. One scorching hot Chicago afternoon in early July when life, along Indiana Avenue, was crawlingly lazy, Studs goes for a walk in Washington Park with the prettiest girl on the block, Lucy Scanlan. As the two fourteen-year-olds head for the parks wooded island, Studs felt, knew, that it was going to be a great afternoon, different from every other afternoon in his whole life.They cross the log bridge over onto the island and decide to climb up beneath the leafy dome of a huge oak tree and sit on a branch. Up in the tree it is as if they are removed from . . . the world . . . where Studs feels obliged to be so tough:The breeze playing upon them through the tree leaves was fine. Studs just sat there and let it play upon him, let it sift through his hair. . . . The wind seemed to Studs like the fingers of a girl, of Lucy, and when it moved through the leaves it was like a girl, like Lucy, running her hand over very expensive silk, like the silk movie actresses wore in the pictures. . . . They sat. Studs swinging his legs, and Lucy swinging hers, she chattering, himself not listening to it, only knowing that it was nice, and that she laughed and talked and was like an angel, and she was an angel playing in the sun. Suddenly, he thought of feeling her up, and he told himself he was a bastard for having such thoughts. He wasnt worthy of her, even of her fingernail, and he side-glanced at her, and he loved her, he loved her with his hands, and his lips, and his eyes, and his heart, and he loved everything about her, her dress, and voice, and the way she smiled, and her eyes, and her hair, and Lucy, all of her.With that, Studs has enclosed himself in the cocoon of perfect love, sublime love. A century of psychologists and neuroscientists perfect in their rationalismnot to mention Studss gottabe tough, therefore gottabe carnal, therefore gottabe perfectly cynical adolescent cohorts, such as the wonderfully named fourteen-year-old Weary Reillyhave taught us that such sublime moments are merely subliminal wafts on the way to the one goal, which is no loftier than that of dogs in the park, namely, the old in and out.But Studs consciously, or stream-of-consciously, rejects such . . . rationalism . . . dismisses the notion of feeling her up and reduces the world to two people or perhaps only one. They sat. Farrell keeps repeating that sentence until it is like the ticking of a very big old clock. Studs and Lucy sat high up on a tree limb within a bower of leaves so thick, they shut out everything except the glittering surface of the lagoon and the sounds of children. There was no outside world. There was only Lucy, every perfect breath she breathed, every perfect morsel of her existence. Who, including any of the 20,000 attendees at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, can truthfully say that sublime feeling of two creatures dissolving into a single soul is not more thrilling than, in Rabelaiss phrase, playing the two-backed beast?He wanted the afternoon never to end, so that he and Lucy could sit there forever; her hands stole timidly into his, and he forgot everything in the world but Lucy. . . . And Time passed through their afternoon like a gentle, tender wind, and like death that was silent and cruel. . . . They sat, and about them their beautiful afternoon evaporated, split up and died like sun that was dying a red death in the calm sky.This invocation of deathred, silent, and cruelcreates a mood of foreboding, if my own reaction to it is any measure. The next thing Studs knows, there are graffiti scrawled on walls along Indiana Avenue reading studs loves lucy . . . lucy is crazy about studs . . . and others in that vein. Studs feels like a goofthe term boys used seventy years ago to mean dorkand hastily puts back on his bullet-proof vestments of gottabe tough, therefore gottabe carnal, therefore gottabe cynical. They had sat . . . and that afternoon up in the tree, we eventually learn, was to be the last touch of the sublime in Studs Lonigans short life.The Studs Lonigan trilogy eventually totalled 919 pages. The life of every individual, sayeth the sage, runs along the line created by the intersection of two planes: personality and social setting. I cant think of any American novelist who ever drew that line more brilliantly than James T. Farrell in this trilogy. If this be plodding realism, let every American novelist start plodding Studs-style, lest the American novel fall down in a heap and die, as it now seems wont to do.Total Points: 3(TW 3)""Wolf Whistle by Lewis Nordan (1993).Nordan unleashes the hellhounds of his prodigious imagination on one of the most notorious racial killings of the century, the Emmett Till murder.

Among oddly afflicted and recognizable players, the terminologies of football and nuclear war-the language of end zones-become interchangeable, and their meaning deteriorates as the collegiate year runs its course. Tom LeClair writes: Underworld is DeLillos masterwork, but End Zone is my personal favorite, probably because it (along with Robert Coovers Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.) showed me how a sports novel could ratchet up to treat the most serious of cultural subjects, in DeLillos case nuclear annihilation.

During his brief life he turned out eight plays, among which is the marvelous one-act Robert Guiscard; eight stories, including the novella Michael Kohlaas; and a long story, The Marquise of O. He also wrote a philosophical discourse, On the Puppet Theatre, a group of anecdotes, and some brilliant journalism.Von Kleist was a true Romantic, yet he is utterly modern in the swiftness and depth of his perception of his subjects. Perhaps he didnt choose themthey chose him, as it often seems with such a writer, a kind of fatality of choice.In Michael Kohlaas von Kleist writes of the passion for justice turning a man into an outlaw. In The Beggarwoman of Locarno, a three-page arrow of a short story, a man sets fire to his own house. The Marquise of Obegins with an advertisement, placed in journals by a widowed Marquise, that pleads for the father of the child she is carrying to come forward and marry her.

Ethel and Julius Rosenberg are scheduled to fry in the electric chair in Times Square, and Uncle Sam has delegated Vice President Richard Nixon (who narrates much of the story) to ensure that the show goes off. Coover is a master of lingos, from Uncle Sams Davy Crockett yawps to Nixons resentful Rotarian tones.

This modern morality tale juxtaposes its protagonists tortuous cerebral musings with a visceral world of blood and bile, sexual deviance, and medically sanctioned infanticide. Os grotesqueries paradoxically render his characters more human and sympathetic, rather than less, while the sometimes self-conscious artifice of his language accommodates a society adrift from tradition and meaning.Total Points: 1(DMe 1)""A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan (2010).Bennie is an aging former punk rocker and record executive.

Both stories are early, critical entries in a narrative series I'm doing about a family of settlers in twentieth-century New York, the Glasses. It is a long-term project, patently an ambiguous one, and there is a real-enough danger, I suppose that sooner or later I'll bog down, perhaps disappear entirely, in my own methods, locutions, and mannerisms.

When he returns to his village in rural Haiti, he finds that a drought has ravaged the entire area and a Romeo and Juliettype feud between the two most powerful families stands in the communitys way of finding a solution.Like Romeo, the young man, Manuel, falls in love with the stunning daughter of the family that despises his and a battle ensues that results in tragedy, with some measure of hope. (To say much more would be giving away too much of the plot of this slim volume.) The book has often been called a peasant novel, but it is also an environmental novel, as well as a love story.I read this book when I was ten years old; it was the first novel in which I recognized people I knew living in circumstances similar to my life and my world. It was also the first time that I realized books could not only help us escape but hold a mirror to our lives, to help us examine a problem and ponderalong with the charactersa possible solution. It was my first engage or socially engaged novel, one that showed me that the novel could have many roles, that fiction could be used for different purposes without losing its artistic merit. It made me want to write the types of books that could inform and entertain as well as help others live, through a powerful narrative, a heartbreaking, painful, and even redemptive experience.Total Points: 1(ED 1)""Maud Martha by Gwendolyn Brooks (1953).
